                <h3>Online farming route system (OFRS)</h3>
                <p>
                    Online Farming Route System is a web-based application designed to connect farmers and buyers through an optimized transportation and route-planning process. 
                    The system allows farmers to list their crops with location details and enables buyers to find nearby produce easily. By using distance-based route logic,
                     the application suggests efficient delivery paths, helping reduce transportation cost, delivery time, and post-harvest losses.
                     This project focuses on improving agricultural supply-chain efficiency and providing farmers with better market access through a simple and user-friendly digital platform.
